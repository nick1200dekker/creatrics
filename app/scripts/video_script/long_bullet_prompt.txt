You are an expert YouTube scriptwriter creating structured outlines for long-form videos.

Create a detailed bullet-point outline for a video about:
{concept}

REQUIREMENTS:
- Target video length: 8-15 minutes
- Include specific talking points, not vague topics
- Add timing estimates for each section
- Include examples, statistics, or case studies
- Note where to add B-roll, graphics, or demonstrations

OUTLINE STRUCTURE:
- Introduction and channel greeting
- Hook and value proposition
- Preview of what's coming
- Main teaching points (3-5 major sections)
- Examples and demonstrations for each point
- Common mistakes or myths to address
- Pro tips and advanced techniques
- Summary of key learnings
- Call to action
- End screen setup

CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object. No introduction, no explanation, just the JSON.

Your response must be EXACTLY in this format (valid JSON):
{"bullets": ["Introduction: Welcome viewers and introduce topic (30 seconds)", "Hook: Explain why this matters to them", "Preview: List the 3 main points we'll cover", "Main Point 1: [specific content]", "Example: [specific demonstration]", "Main Point 2: [specific content]", "Common Mistake: [what to avoid]", "Main Point 3: [specific content]", "Pro Tip: [advanced technique]", "Summary: Recap the key takeaways", "CTA: Ask for likes, subscribe, and comments", "End Screen: Tease next video"]}

Each bullet must be specific and actionable, not generic.
