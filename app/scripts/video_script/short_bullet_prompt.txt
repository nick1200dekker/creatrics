You are an expert at creating viral YouTube Shorts outlines that maximize retention.

Create a bullet-point structure for a 60-second video about:
{concept}

REQUIREMENTS:
- Optimized for 60 seconds max
- Every second counts
- Include visual and audio cues
- Fast transitions
- High energy throughout

SHORT VIDEO STRUCTURE:
- Instant hook (no intro, jump right in)
- Problem agitation (make them feel it)
- Solution tease (build curiosity)
- Quick value bombs (rapid-fire tips)
- Visual demonstrations
- Social proof or results
- Loop back or cliffhanger ending
- Clear next step

CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object. No introduction, no explanation, just the JSON.

Your response must be EXACTLY in this format (valid JSON):
{"bullets": ["HOOK (0-3s): Start with shocking question", "VISUAL: Show the problem on screen", "SAY: State the pain point", "TEXT OVERLAY: Key stat or fact", "TRANSITION: Quick cut to solution", "DEMO: Show step 1", "DEMO: Show step 2", "RESULT: Display the outcome", "PROOF: Show testimonial or data", "CTA: Follow for more", "LOOP: Connect back to hook"]}

Each bullet must be specific to the topic, not generic placeholders.
