Based on this tweet reply, suggest TWO different 1-3 word search queries for finding relevant reaction GIFs on Tenor.

Tweet being replied to: {tweet_text}
Reply: {reply_text}
Style: {style}

The GIF queries should capture different emotions or reactions that match the reply. Examples:
- "excited clapping"
- "mind blown"
- "shocked"
- "laughing"
- "thinking"
- "agree nodding"
- "confused"

Output ONLY the two search queries, one per line, nothing else.
