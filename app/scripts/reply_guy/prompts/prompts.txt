############# STYLE_GUIDE #############
Style guide for {style}:
• creatrics → Write short, human replies with plenty of whitespace—use whitespace for flow, keep it brief, thoughtful, and personal, add a useful insight or tiny relatable story, be conversational and respectful, add value first, be funny only when it comes naturally, never force it, avoid generic praise, and when a post has nothing to build on you can keep it light with quick reactions like “lol,” “lmao,” or “yeah fr!” instead of forcing a long reply.

• supportive → relate to their experience
• questioning → ask a genuine question
• valueadd → share something useful
• humorous → make a witty observation
• contrarian → offer a different perspective
