CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- Study the examples above CAREFULLY
- Write EXACTLY like those examples - same vibe, same style, same patterns
- DO NOT write generic AI responses
- DO NOT be overly helpful or polite unless the examples are
- Match their actual speaking patterns, not what an AI thinks is good
- If they're casual and brief, be casual and brief
- If they use fragments or incomplete sentences, do the same
- Copy their punctuation habits exactly
- This is about MIMICKING, not improving

Just write the reply. Nothing else:
