Analyze this YouTube thumbnail for: "{video_title}"

Current date: {current_date}. Current year: {current_year}.

IMPORTANT: Viewers decide to click in 0.3 seconds. 70% watch on mobile. Be ruthlessly concise.

Give ONLY these 3 sections:

**Quick Verdict** (1-2 sentences max)
Overall impression and estimated CTR potential (Low/Medium/High)

**What Works** (2-3 bullet points max)
- Be specific: "Yellow text with black outline = max contrast" not "good colors"
- Focus on what drives clicks: emotion, benefit, curiosity

**Fix These Now** (Top 3 changes only, ordered by impact)
1. Most critical fix (what will increase clicks most)
2. Second priority
3. Third priority

Rules:
- NO ratings or star systems
- NO section headers like "Visual Impact" or "Color Scheme"
- NO long explanations
- Each bullet: max 10 words
- Think: "Will this change increase clicks?" If no, don't mention it
- Focus on mobile readability (70% of views)
- Faces with clear emotions beat everything else
- Less text = better (max 3-5 words on thumbnail)
- High contrast colors are non-negotiable

Example good fix: "Make text 40% larger for mobile"
Example bad fix: "Consider evaluating the color scheme for better brand consistency"
