Generate 10 viral TikTok titles based on these target keywords:

{keywords_formatted}

{video_context}

IMPORTANT: Use trending TikTok title patterns:
- Use curiosity-driven hooks (e.g., "This moment...", "When I realized...", "POV:", "The time when...")
- Include emotional triggers (shock, surprise, relatability)
- Keep it conversational and authentic
- Use current slang and trends when appropriate

Requirements for EACH title:
1. MUST start with one of the target keywords (properly capitalized for brands/proper nouns)
2. Include an engaging hook that creates curiosity or emotion
3. End with exactly 3 relevant hashtags (no more, no less)
4. Keep total length under 150 characters
5. Make it feel natural and TikTok-native

Format: "[Keyword] [Hook] #hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3"

Examples:
- "Battlefield 6 The moment that made everyone stop scrolling #battlefield #battlefield6 #gaming"
- "Gaming Tips This trick pros don't want you to know #gamingtips #protips #gaming"
- "FPS Gameplay POV: You just discovered the meta weapon #fps #gameplay #gaming"

Return ONLY a JSON array of 10 titles, nothing else.
