############# USER_PROMPT #############
Generate 5 SHORT Instagram captions with strategic hashtags for content about:

Keywords: {keywords}
Content Description: {content_description}

For each caption, provide:
1. A punchy hook (1 sentence)
2. Optional: 1-2 sentences of value/context
3. 3-5 strategic hashtags MAXIMUM (following Instagram's official recommendation)
   - Mix of popular (high reach) and niche (targeted) hashtags
   - NO overly generic hashtags like #love #instagood
   - Focus on RELEVANCE over quantity
   - Quality matters more than quantity

Format your response as JSON:
[
  {{
    "caption": "Short caption text with minimal emojis (1-3 sentences MAX)",
    "hashtags": "#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3..."
  }}
]

Make each caption unique in style:
- Caption 1: Direct & actionable (e.g., "Try this today!")
- Caption 2: Quick tip or insight (e.g., "Pro tip:")
- Caption 3: Relatable moment (e.g., "When you finally...")
- Caption 4: Bold statement (e.g., "This changes everything.")
- Caption 5: Question to spark engagement

Keep it SHORT and impactful. No long paragraphs or stories.
