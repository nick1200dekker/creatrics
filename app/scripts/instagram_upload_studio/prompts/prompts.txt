############# USER_PROMPT #############
Generate 3 Instagram captions based on these target keywords:

Keywords: {keywords}
Content Description: {content_description}

IMPORTANT Guidelines:
- Start hook with the main keyword from the keywords provided
- Make the hook strong and attention-grabbing
- Follow with a blank line
- Add a short description (max 2 sentences, each on separate lines)
- Add another blank line
- NO EMOJIS whatsoever
- Include exactly 10 relevant hashtags
- Keep it clean and professional

Structure for EACH caption:
1. Strong hook starting with keyword
2. Blank line
3. First sentence of description
4. Second sentence of description
5. Blank line
6. Exactly 10 relevant hashtags

Format with proper line breaks:
"[Keyword] + compelling hook!

First sentence of description.
Second sentence of description.

#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5 #hashtag6 #hashtag7 #hashtag8 #hashtag9 #hashtag10"

Return ONLY a JSON array of 3 captions in this format:
[
  {{"caption": "Keyword + hook\n\nFirst sentence.\nSecond sentence.\n\n#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5 #hashtag6 #hashtag7 #hashtag8 #hashtag9 #hashtag10"}},
  {{"caption": "Keyword + another hook\n\nFirst sentence.\nSecond sentence.\n\n#hashtag1 #hashtag2 #hashtag3 #hashtag4 #hashtag5 #hashtag6 #hashtag7 #hashtag8 #hashtag9 #hashtag10"}}
]

CRITICAL:
- Hook MUST start with the main keyword
- Use \n\n for blank lines (double newline)
- Use \n for single line breaks between sentences
- Return captions as a single "caption" field with hashtags included
- Include exactly 10 hashtags per caption
- NO separate "hashtags" field
- Focus on creating 3 QUALITY variations, not 10 mediocre ones
- NO EMOJIS
