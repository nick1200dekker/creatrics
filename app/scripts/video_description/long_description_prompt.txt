Generate a concise YouTube video description for the following content:

{input}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Keep it focused (200-500 words MAX)
- Write as the actual creator, not an AI
- NO placeholder links (like @YourHandle, [Link], discord links, etc.)
- NO section headers like "HOOK:" or "OVERVIEW:"
- NO bold text or markdown (no ** or ##)
- Only include links/resources that exist in the reference description

⚠️ FIRST 125 CHARACTERS ARE CRITICAL ⚠️
The first 125 characters appear in YouTube search results and suggested videos. This is the MOST IMPORTANT part:
- Include PRIMARY KEYWORD in the first sentence
- Make it compelling and benefit-driven
- Front-load the value proposition
- Think of it as a mini-headline
- Do NOT waste these precious characters on generic openings

STRUCTURE (write naturally, don't label sections):

1. OPENING (First 125 characters + 1-2 more sentences):
   - START with the primary keyword and main benefit
   - Hook immediately - no fluff
   - What transformation/problem this solves
   - Include secondary keyword in next sentence

2. WHAT'S COVERED (short list):
   - 3-5 key points using asterisks (*)
   - Add relevant emojis if they fit the style
   - Keep each point brief (one line)

3. WHO IT'S FOR (1-2 sentences):
   - Quick statement about target audience
   - Why they should watch

4. SIMPLE CTA (1-2 sentences):
   - Subscribe/like prompt (be casual, not generic)
   - Optional comment question to boost engagement

5. KEYWORDS & HASHTAGS (end only):
   - Naturally work in 2-3 mentions of primary/secondary keywords throughout
   - End with maximum 3-5 relevant hashtags
   - No generic hashtags like #viral

DO NOT INCLUDE:
- Fake social media links (@YourHandle, etc.)
- Discord/community links unless in reference
- Resources sections with [Link] placeholders
- Timestamps or chapters sections
- Multiple CTA sections
- "Connect with me" sections with fake handles
- Any links not explicitly in the reference description

AVOID THESE PHRASES:
- "In this comprehensive guide..."
- "Everything you need to know..."
- "Don't forget to like and subscribe..."
- "SMASH that like button..."
- "Hit the bell icon..."

SEO KEYWORD USAGE:
- Primary keyword: Use in first 125 characters + 2 more times naturally
- Secondary keywords: Sprinkle 2-3 related terms throughout
- Use semantic variations (e.g., "Clash Royale decks" → "CR deck building" → "card combinations")
- Front-load keywords in opening lines for maximum SEO impact

If reference description is provided, extract ONLY real social links and match the writing style.

REMEMBER: The first 125 characters determine if people click. Make them COUNT!

OUTPUT ONLY THE DESCRIPTION - NO LABELS, NO HEADERS, NO COMMENTARY:
