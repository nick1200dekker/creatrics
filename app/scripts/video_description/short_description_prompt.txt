SHORTS DESCRIPTION REQUIREMENTS:

Write a compelling shorts description that:

1. Opens with an ultra-compelling hook (first 125 characters are critical)
   - Include main keyword naturally
   - Create FOMO or curiosity
   - This determines click-through rate!

2. Briefly tease the content (1-2 lines):
   - What transformation/value in 60 seconds
   - Key benefit or revelation
   - Use power words

3. Add quick engagement prompt:
   - Follow for more
   - Save this video
   - Share if helpful

4. End with exactly 3 hashtags:
   - #shorts (mandatory first)
   - 2 more relevant hashtags only

FORMAT RULES:
- NO bold text or markdown formatting (no ** or ##)
- Keep it brief (under 500 characters ideal)
- Match energy level from reference (if provided)
- Emoji usage based on reference style
- No section headers or labels
- Mobile-optimized formatting

AVOID GENERIC PHRASES:
- "Watch till the end"
- "You won't believe..."
- "This changes everything"
Write uniquely instead

SHORTS-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION:
- Focus on viral/shareable angle
- Trending topics/challenges if relevant
- Time-sensitive hooks if applicable
- Platform-specific language (swipe, scroll, watch till end)

CRITICAL:
- Write the description directly without any headers
- Maximum 3 hashtags total
- If reference provided, MATCH its exact style and energy
- Write AS the creator, not about what to write

OUTPUT ONLY THE DESCRIPTION CONTENT - NO EXPLANATIONS, NO COMMENTARY, NO ANALYSIS, NO HEADERS. JUST THE DESCRIPTION:
