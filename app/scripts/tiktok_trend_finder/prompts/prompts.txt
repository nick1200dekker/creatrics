{keywords_text}

Instructions:
- Return keywords that are related to gaming (video games, game titles, gaming culture, gaming creators, esports, streaming, etc.)
- Be FLEXIBLE in your interpretation - keywords may be indirectly gaming-related or could be used in gaming contexts
- Include keywords that gaming audiences would use, even if not exclusively gaming terms
- Examples of what to include: game titles, gaming slang, streaming terms, popular gaming trends, gaming community terms
- IMPORTANT: Many keywords could be unknown game titles (especially Roblox games, indie games, or new releases) - only exclude keywords if you are 100% certain they are NOT gaming-related
- When in doubt, include it - it's better to be over-inclusive than to miss potential gaming content
- Do NOT change or modify the keywords in any way
- Return ONLY the gaming-related keywords, one per line
- Do NOT include explanations, numbering, or any other text
- If a keyword has potential gaming relevance, include it
