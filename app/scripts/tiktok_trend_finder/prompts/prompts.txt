Instructions:
- Be STRICT: Only return keywords that are VIDEO GAMES and GAME TITLES
- Include: video game titles, gaming platforms, gaming genres, esports, game-specific terms
- Examples: minecraft, fortnite, roblox, valorant, leagueoflegends, playstation, xbox, fps, rpg, speedrun
- EXCLUDE: Gaming creators/streamers (e.g., "pewdiepie", "ninja") - we only want games, not people
- EXCLUDE: TV shows, movies, anime, general entertainment content (e.g., "smilingfriends" is a TV show, NOT a game)
- EXCLUDE: General internet culture, memes, or trends not specifically about gaming
- Only include a keyword if it is clearly a video game title or gaming activity
- When in doubt, EXCLUDE it - we need high-quality gaming-only results
- FIRST: Filter the list above to only gaming-related keywords
- THEN: If you have less than 100 keywords, add popular/hot video game titles that are trending right now to reach 100 total keywords
- Return exactly 100 gaming keywords, one per line
