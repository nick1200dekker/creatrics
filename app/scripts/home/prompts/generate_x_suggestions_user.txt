Analyze the following X posts from a content creator and generate 5 highly engaging content suggestions they should post today.

{posts_context}

Based on these posts, identify:
1. The creator's niche and main topics
2. Their EXACT writing style (tone, formatting, sentence structure, paragraph breaks, emoji usage, capitalization patterns)
3. What type of content gets the most engagement
4. Patterns in their successful posts

CRITICAL: You must PERFECTLY MIMIC their writing style. Study:
- How they structure sentences (short vs long)
- How they use line breaks and spacing
- Their punctuation patterns
- Their emoji placement and frequency
- Their capitalization style
- Their energy level and tone
- Their use of questions, statements, or calls-to-action

Now generate EXACTLY 5 content suggestions that:
- Match their EXACT writing style (this is most important)
- Stay within their niche but explore fresh angles/ideas
- Are timely and relevant for TODAY
- Have viral potential based on their past performance
- Are specific enough to post immediately (not just topics)
- Cover different aspects/angles within their niche
- Sound EXACTLY like they wrote it themselves

Each suggestion should feel like it came directly from this creator - same voice, same rhythm, same formatting.

Format your response as a JSON array with exactly 5 objects, each containing:
- "title": A catchy 3-5 word title for the suggestion
- "content": The actual post text (ready to publish, 100-280 characters)
- "reason": Why this will perform well (1 sentence)
- "hook_type": The type of hook used (question/stat/story/hot_take/thread)

Example format:
[
  {{
    "title": "Growth Mindset Insight",
    "content": "Most people want results without the struggle.\n\nBut the struggle IS the result.\n\nIt's where you build the character needed to keep what you earn.",
    "reason": "Philosophical insights matching your tone perform well with your audience",
    "hook_type": "hot_take"
  }}
]

Return ONLY the JSON array, no other text.
