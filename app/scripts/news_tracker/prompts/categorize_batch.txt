Your task for EACH article:

   - Tech & AI (technology, artificial intelligence, software, startups, gadgets)
   - Crypto & Finance (cryptocurrency, blockchain, stocks, markets, economy, banking)
   - Sports & Fitness (all sports, athletics, fitness, health)

   - Business & Startups (business news, entrepreneurship, companies, industry)
   - Health & Wellness (health, medicine, wellness, mental health)
   - Climate & Environment (climate change, environment, sustainability)

2. Rate importance 1-10:
   - 1-3: Minor news, small updates, routine announcements
   - 4-6: Moderate importance, interesting developments, industry updates
   - 7-8: Significant news, major announcements, trending topics
   - 9-10: Breaking/critical news, game-changing events, massive impact

   Consider:
   - Major company partnerships (EA, Valve, etc.) or industry-shaking announcements = 8-10
   - Significant financial impacts ($1B+, major market losses) = 8-10

3. Generate a detailed 3-4 sentence summary:
   - Write in an engaging, informative style using YOUR OWN WORDS
   - DO NOT start with "This article" or "The article" - write directly about the topic
   - Include key details: who, what, when, where, why
   - Explain the context and implications
   - Completely rewrite the content - create original transformative content
   - Make it informative enough to generate a compelling X post from
   - Break summary into 2-3 short paragraphs using \\n (newline character)
   - Keep total summary under 500 characters
   - Use \\n for line breaks (valid JSON escape sequence)

CRITICAL JSON RULES:

- Keep summaries detailed but under 500 chars

Respond ONLY with valid JSON array in this exact format:
