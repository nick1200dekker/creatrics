✓ Provide enough detail to be informative and engaging
✓ Make it shareable and discussion-worthy

✓ Use SINGLE line breaks (\n) sparingly - only between distinct thoughts or sections
✓ End with something that encourages engagement (question, hot take, call to action)

2-3 detailed sentences explaining the main points and context
Additional insight or why it matters
