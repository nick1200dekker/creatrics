Transform these raw keywords, bullet points, or rough notes into a polished X/Twitter post that sounds professional and engaging.

{VOICE_CONTEXT}

YOUR TASK:
Take disconnected ideas/keywords and craft them into a cohesive, scroll-stopping post.

ANALYZE THESE PROVEN VIRAL POSTS FIRST:

Example 1: The Bold Promise + Proof Pattern
---
Writing viral posts will never be a struggle again...

I packaged every context file, example, and framework that got me 4.5M+ impressions into one Claude skill.

Just upload it to your project and Claude instantly references:
- 20+ tweets with 100K+ views each
- Proven hook formulas
- Writing principles that actually work
- Real feedback on what converts (and what flops)

Most people prompt Claude with zero context and wonder why their posts sound generic.

They're basically asking it to write blind.

This skill changes that completely.

You upload it once to your Claude account and it becomes part of Claude's memory.

Now when you say "write a post about X," Claude pulls from battle-tested patterns.

- It knows which hooks are overused and market-fatigued.
- It understands how to structure posts for maximum engagement.
- It references actual examples that crushed it.

The skill teaches Claude to write posts that actually convert, and it never runs out of fresh angles.

Claude gets better the more you use it together, because you can keep adding to the skill over time.

This is the new way to add context to AI.

No more copy-pasting examples into every chat.

No more re-explaining your style from scratch.

Follow + comment "SKILL" and I'll DM you the file

Example 2: The Contrarian Take Pattern
---
Hot Take: If you hear someone saying there are "too many coins" for alt season

they are don't understand crypto

There have always been "too many coins" for the existing liquidity since I got here in 2017

Never once did every single coin pump, there have always been dead projects

The only metric that matters is Bitcoin Dominance

When there's demand for alts, it won't be hard to find winners

Think of it like this:

You can create a website in 5 seconds, does that make sites like Amazon less valuable? Facebook? Twitter? Google? ofc not

Some websites are more valuable BECAUSE of others (i.e. search engine) 

This is true of DEX coins, launchpads etc. They benefit from more coins, more trading

When alts are in demand there will be HUGE winners with sustained rallies. Attention will power law to those, and boom bang pow 

ALT SEASON

Due to FED policy and macro flows, there's just not as much demand for high risk things right now

We're seeing the end of this regime. When it fully shifts, the amount of tokens won't stop the good coins from winning 

Delusional bulls will inherit the earth

Example 3: The Stack Reveal Pattern
---
My CURRENT AI tool stack:

I used to use 10-15 AI tools, now literally 90%+ of the work I do is handled by TWO:

1) Claude Code: I build websites, landing pages, do research, create strategies, craft content. This is my workhorse for everything that I do. 

*I use two MCPs: Perplexity & Firecrawl and one skill: Voice & Copy.

2) Cursor: I use the agent with GPT-5 as a research and debugging assistant. I think of it as a complement to what I do in Claude Code. Cursor is also my workspace.

Sure sometimes I use ChatGPT on the web, Gemini, Claude Desktop, n8n, etc. for certain things - but they are less than 10% at this point.

The more you progress, the fewer tools you need. Focus in on what drives results, ignore the rest.

WHAT MAKES THESE POSTS WORK:

Hook Patterns:
- Bold promises with proof ("4.5M+ impressions", "90%+ of the work")
- Contrarian statements ("they don't understand crypto")
- Personal revelations ("My CURRENT AI tool stack")
- Specific numbers breed credibility

Structure Analysis:
- Opening hook → Proof/credentials → Problem → Solution → Details → Strong close with CTA
- Controversial statement → Counter objection → Analogy → Build logic → Bold prediction
- Personal shift → Simplification → Detailed breakdown → Philosophical ending

Whitespace Strategy:
- Line breaks after every 1-2 sentences for rhythm
- Bullet points for scannable value (never hashtags)
- Space before key transitions
- Breathing room around strongest claims

Voice Elements:
- Casual confidence ("boom bang pow", "ofc not")
- Authentic grammar quirks preserved ("they are don't understand")
- Specific numbers (4.5M+, 10-15, 90%+)
- Direct language, zero fluff

PROVEN HOOK FORMULAS:

1. The Bold Promise: "[Outcome] will never be [problem] again..."
2. The Contrarian: "Hot Take: [common belief] is wrong"
3. The Reveal: "My CURRENT [thing] stack:"
4. The Pattern Interrupt: "Everyone does [X]. I did [opposite] and [result]"
5. The Specificity Play: Lead with precise numbers/metrics

WRITING PRINCIPLES THAT ACTUALLY WORK:

1. Specificity over vagueness
   Bad: "I got lots of engagement"
   Good: "4.5M+ impressions"

2. Show the transformation
   Pattern: "I used to X, now Y"
   Before state → After state → How

3. Bullets for value delivery
   - Use dashes for listicle content
   - Keep each bullet tight (one clear benefit)
   - Never use hashtags

4. Strategic whitespace
   - More line breaks = easier reading
   - Space around transitions
   - Visual rhythm matters

5. End with momentum
   - Question that sparks replies
   - Bold statement that demands attention
   - Clear CTA ("Follow + comment")
   - Philosophical mic drop

6. Authenticity beats perfection
   - Keep natural language patterns
   - Don't over-polish casual voice
   - Deliberate informality works

X POST OPTIMIZATION RULES:
1. NO HASHTAGS - Never use hashtags
2. NO MARKDOWN - Never use **, ##, headers, or any markdown formatting
3. Strategic whitespace - Add line breaks between key points for rhythm
4. Magnetic hook - Turn the main keyword into an attention-grabbing opener
5. Visual hierarchy - Use spacing to create easy scanning
6. Human voice - Sound like a real person, not a robot assembling keywords
7. Sentence variety - Mix short punchy lines with medium ones
8. Strong close - End with insight, question, or call-to-action
9. Direct language - Expand keywords into complete thoughts
10. Selective emojis - Only 1-3 if they amplify key points

KEYWORD-TO-POST TRANSFORMATION:
- Identify the core message from the keywords
- Build a logical narrative flow
- Expand each keyword into a complete thought
- Add necessary context without overexplaining
- Connect ideas with smooth transitions
- Remove redundancy and jargon
- Make it conversational, not a list
- Lead with the strongest idea, not chronologically

CONTENT PRO APPROACH:
- What's the ONE big idea here?
- Which keyword is most attention-grabbing?
- How would you explain this to a friend?
- What's the "so what?" for readers?
- Does it sound natural when read aloud?

STRUCTURE OPTIONS:
- Problem → Solution
- Before → After
- Mistake → Fix
- Question → Answer
- Claim → Proof
- Story → Lesson

Framework Example:

INPUT:
The "Punchline First" Formula - How to Instantly Hook Your Audience. Struggling to make your writing or storytelling land? The secret is the "Punchline First" approach—start strong, hook your audience, and then take them on the journey.

The Big Mistake: Most people bury their best content at the end, losing their audience before they get to the good part. Here's how to fix it with examples and practical tips.

OUTPUT:
Most storytellers make this fatal mistake

They bury the best part at the end
When everyone stopped listening

Example:
So I was at this restaurant...
(2 minutes of buildup)
...and then Shaq walked in!

Too late
Your audience is gone

The simple fix?

Start with "I met Shaq last night"
Then tell the story

More real examples 🔥

Bad: "I've been thinking about productivity..."
Good: "Waking up early won't make you productive"

Bad: "Let me introduce myself..."
Good: "I made $50K from one tweet"

Bad: "Today we'll discuss leadership..."
Good: "The best leaders don't actually lead"

The formula:
- Hook with your best point
- Create instant curiosity
- Tell the full story

Never save your best for last
Your first line is everything

Transformed version:

############# mimic #############
COMPLETE REWRITE REQUIRED. Analyze the reference examples deeply, then rewrite this post from scratch to match that EXACT voice signature.

{VOICE_CONTEXT}

CRITICAL LENGTH RULE: DO NOT EXPAND THE POST. Match the original post length closely. Focus on matching the voice and style, not adding more content. If original is short, keep it short.

VOICE SIGNATURE ELEMENTS TO COPY EXACTLY:
1. Grammar patterns (if examples use "completly" or "dont" - you must too)
2. Contraction style (don't vs dont, I've vs ive)
3. Signature openers ("man", "look", "here's the thing", "so")
4. Energy level (hyped vs chill, formal vs casual)
5. Punctuation rhythm (..., -, !, ?)
6. Vocabulary range (sophisticated vs simple)
7. Line break patterns and pacing
8. Tone fingerprint (sarcastic, earnest, bold, humble)
9. Sentence structure preferences (short/long mix ratio)
10. Personality quirks and repeated phrases

MIMIC LIKE A CONTENT PRO:
- Read examples until you HEAR the voice
- Copy mistakes if they're consistent patterns
- Match energy before matching words
- Preserve their unique style signatures
- Don't "improve" - REPLICATE

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:
- Fixing grammar the examples consistently use
- Making formal what's intentionally casual
- Using complex words when examples are simple
- Cleaning up their stylistic choices
- Adding polish they don't have
- Removing personality for "correctness"

Original text:

REWRITE EVERY SENTENCE FROM SCRATCH. Transform this into content the reference author would actually write. Match their voice so well their audience couldn't tell the difference. Keep the same approximate length as the original.

OUTPUT ONLY THE REWRITTEN POST - NO EXPLANATIONS, NO COMMENTARY, NO ANALYSIS. JUST THE CONTENT IN THEIR VOICE:

Rewritten version:

- "Delusional bulls will inherit the earth"

FORMATTING STANDARDS:
- Short, deliberate sentences
- Line breaks create reading rhythm
- No unnecessary quote marks
- Only essential story details
- Simple, active language
- Whitespace between thoughts for pacing
- Clear call-to-action or question at end
- Preserve original emojis in context
- CRITICAL: Match original post length - don't expand
