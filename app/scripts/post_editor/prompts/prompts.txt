############# braindump #############
Transform these raw keywords, bullet points, or rough notes into a polished X/Twitter post that sounds professional and engaging.

{VOICE_CONTEXT}

YOUR TASK:
Take disconnected ideas/keywords and craft them into a cohesive, scroll-stopping post.

X POST OPTIMIZATION RULES:
1. NO HASHTAGS - Never use hashtags
2. Strategic whitespace - Add line breaks between key points for rhythm
3. Magnetic hook - Turn the main keyword into an attention-grabbing opener
4. Visual hierarchy - Use spacing to create easy scanning
5. Human voice - Sound like a real person, not a robot assembling keywords
6. Sentence variety - Mix short punchy lines with medium ones
7. Strong close - End with insight, question, or call-to-action
8. Direct language - Expand keywords into complete thoughts
9. Selective emojis - Only 1-3 if they amplify key points

KEYWORD-TO-POST TRANSFORMATION:
- Identify the core message from the keywords
- Build a logical narrative flow
- Expand each keyword into a complete thought
- Add necessary context without overexplaining
- Connect ideas with smooth transitions
- Remove redundancy and jargon
- Make it conversational, not a list
- Lead with the strongest idea, not chronologically

CONTENT PRO APPROACH:
- What's the ONE big idea here?
- Which keyword is most attention-grabbing?
- How would you explain this to a friend?
- What's the "so what?" for readers?
- Does it sound natural when read aloud?

STRUCTURE OPTIONS:
- Problem â†’ Solution
- Before â†’ After
- Mistake â†’ Fix
- Question â†’ Answer
- Claim â†’ Proof
- Story â†’ Lesson

Improved version:

############# hook_story_punch #############
Rewrite this post using the Hook-Story-Punch framework. Make it scroll-stopping content.

{VOICE_CONTEXT}

HOOK (First 1-2 Lines):
- Lead with your most provocative insight
- Create instant tension or curiosity
- Use pattern interrupts (questions, contradictions, bold claims)
- Make it impossible to scroll past

STORY (Middle Section):
- Build one clear idea per line
- Use whitespace as a storytelling tool
- Create visual rhythm that pulls readers down
- Add momentum with progression
- Strategic emojis that enhance (not decorate)
- Use concrete examples over abstract concepts

PUNCH (Final Lines):
- Land with impact
- Ask questions that spark comments
- Create a "mic drop" moment
- Make sharing feel natural

FORMATTING RULES:
- Each thought = 1-2 lines max
- Strategic line breaks for rhythm
- Emojis only where they add meaning
- Never use hashtags
- Simple bullets (â€¢) if needed
- No markdown (**, ##, etc.)
- Match original length naturally
- Keep all @mentions intact

CONTENT PRO STANDARDS:
- Every line must earn its place
- Cut anything that doesn't drive the story
- Write like you're explaining to a friend
- Build tension then deliver payoff
- Make the structure invisible

Examples:

INPUT:
The "Punchline First" Formula - How to Instantly Hook Your Audience. Struggling to make your writing or storytelling land? The secret is the "Punchline First" approachâ€”start strong, hook your audience, and then take them on the journey.

The Big Mistake: Most people bury their best content at the end, losing their audience before they get to the good part. Here's how to fix it with examples and practical tips.

OUTPUT:
Most storytellers make this fatal mistake

They bury the best part at the end
When everyone stopped listening

Example:
So I was at this restaurant...
(2 minutes of buildup)
...and then Shaq walked in!

Too late
Your audience is gone

The simple fix?

Start with "I met Shaq last night"
Then tell the story

More real examples ðŸ”¥

Bad: "I've been thinking about productivity..."
Good: "Waking up early won't make you productive"

Bad: "Let me introduce myself..."
Good: "I made $50K from one tweet"

Bad: "Today we'll discuss leadership..."
Good: "The best leaders don't actually lead"

The formula:
- Hook with your best point
- Create instant curiosity
- Tell the full story

Never save your best for last
Your first line is everything

############# mimic #############
COMPLETE REWRITE REQUIRED. Analyze the reference examples deeply, then rewrite this post from scratch to match that EXACT voice signature.

{VOICE_CONTEXT}

VOICE SIGNATURE ELEMENTS TO COPY EXACTLY:
1. Grammar patterns (if examples use "completly" or "dont" - you must too)
2. Contraction style (don't vs dont, I've vs ive)
3. Signature openers ("man", "look", "here's the thing", "so")
4. Energy level (hyped vs chill, formal vs casual)
5. Punctuation rhythm (..., -, !, ?)
6. Vocabulary range (sophisticated vs simple)
7. Line break patterns and pacing
8. Tone fingerprint (sarcastic, earnest, bold, humble)
9. Sentence structure preferences (short/long mix ratio)
10. Personality quirks and repeated phrases

MIMIC LIKE A CONTENT PRO:
- Read examples until you HEAR the voice
- Copy mistakes if they're consistent patterns
- Match energy before matching words
- Preserve their unique style signatures
- Don't "improve" - REPLICATE

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:
- Fixing grammar the examples consistently use
- Making formal what's intentionally casual
- Using complex words when examples are simple
- Cleaning up their stylistic choices
- Adding polish they don't have
- Removing personality for "correctness"
