{tweets_data}

STEP 1: ANALYZE THE TIMELINE

Read through ALL tweets above and identify:
- What themes and topics are getting high engagement
- What types of content are resonating
- What problems/pain points creators are discussing
- What questions people are asking
- What emotions/reactions are driving engagement

RULES FOR STEP 1:
✓ IGNORE all giveaways, ads, promotional content
✓ Focus on genuine content that sparked real engagement
✓ Identify patterns in what's working
✓ Note the underlying themes, not just surface topics
✓ Look for emotional triggers and pain points

#Hot on Timeline#
[Write 2-3 paragraphs analyzing what themes and topics are resonating. Explain WHY these topics are hot without listing engagement numbers in the narrative.]

STEP 2: EXTRACT TRENDING THEMES

#Top Trending Topics#
[List 3-5 trending themes/conversations, formatted as:]
- [Theme/Topic]: @username1 shared [specific content/insight], while @username2 discussed [their angle on same theme]. @username3's post about [specific detail] shows how [what this reveals about the trend]. This is resonating because [underlying reason].

RULES FOR STEP 2:
✓ Show WHO is talking about WHAT with real usernames
✓ Reference specific content from actual tweets
✓ Identify the deeper need/desire behind each trend
✓ Explain WHY each topic is resonating emotionally
✓ Focus on extractable insights, not just descriptions

STEP 3: CREATE ORIGINAL CONTENT IDEAS

#Content Suggestions#
Create 5 original social media posts inspired by the trending themes above.

RULES FOR STEP 3:
✓ Each post should tap into a trending theme but be completely original
✓ Maximum 2-3 sentences per post
✓ Provide genuine value
✓ Match the emotional tone that's working on the timeline
✓ Write posts the user could publish RIGHT NOW on their timeline
✓ No direct references to other creators' posts
✓ Each post should stand alone and make sense without context

CONTENT TYPES TO CREATE:
- Actionable tips related to trending themes
- Contrarian takes on popular topics
- Personal insights about trending challenges
- Solutions to problems being discussed
- Fresh perspectives on hot topics

FORMAT FOR EACH SUGGESTION:
**"[Attention-grabbing opener]"**
[Original insight/tip/perspective that taps into the trending theme but stands alone as valuable content]

QUALITY CHECK FOR EACH POST:
□ Is it inspired by timeline trends but completely original?
□ Could someone share this without needing context?
□ Does it provide real value?
□ Would it fit naturally in today's conversation?
□ Is it something the user could post immediately?

STEP 4: FINAL REVIEW

BEFORE SUBMITTING:
✓ All 5 posts address different trending themes
✓ Each post is self-contained and valuable
✓ No mentions of other creators or their specific posts
✓ All content feels fresh and original
✓ Posts match the energy/tone of what's working

EXAMPLE:
If the timeline showed creators discussing productivity struggles:

**"I was today years old when I learned this..."**
Your productivity system is failing because you're optimizing for output instead of outcomes - switch to measuring results, not hours worked.

**"90% of creators are making this simple mistake"**
Batching content creation sounds efficient until you realize fresh ideas come from daily life - sometimes the best content strategy is no strategy.
