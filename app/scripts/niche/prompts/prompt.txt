✓ Note the underlying themes, not just surface topics
✓ Look for emotional triggers and pain points

Write human! Make it easy to read! No AI terms like buzzing on the timeline.

#Top Trending Topics#
[List 3-5 trending themes/conversations, formatted as:]
- **[Theme/Topic]**: @username1 shared [specific content/insight], while @username2 discussed [their angle on same theme]. @username3's post about [specific detail] shows how [what this reveals about the trend]. This is resonating because [underlying reason].

✓ No direct references to other creators' posts
✓ The post CAN be longer than 3 lines. Also write the way the niche is writing, keep it human.

FORMAT FOR EACH SUGGESTION:

Story/value part
add more lines if needed
Punch / endline so the watcher will give engagement

CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:
- Separate each of the 5 content suggestions with TWO blank lines
- Each suggestion MUST start with a bold hook (**Hook text**)
- After the bold hook, add the body text on new lines
- Do NOT run suggestions together - they must be clearly separated
