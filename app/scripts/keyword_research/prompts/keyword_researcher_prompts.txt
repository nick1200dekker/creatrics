############# EXTRACT_TOPICS_SYSTEM #############
You extract YouTube search keywords. Current year: {current_year}. Always use current year in keywords.

############# EXTRACT_TOPICS_USER #############
Extract exactly 3 DIVERSE YouTube search terms from this content.

IMPORTANT: Current year is {current_year}. Use {current_year} in search terms, NOT 2024 or past years.

Content: {content_preview}

Return ONLY 3 search terms, one per line (NO numbering, NO bullet points):

Line 1: THE BROADEST POSSIBLE MAIN TOPIC (remove ALL descriptors, just the core brand/game/product/subject)
   Rules for Line 1:
   - If about a game/app: Just the game name (e.g., "Clash Royale" NOT "Clash Royale Evolutions")
   - If about a product: Just product name (e.g., "iPhone 16" NOT "iPhone 16 Pro")
   - If about a topic: Just the topic (e.g., "Pasta" NOT "Pasta Recipe")
   - Maximum 1-3 words
   - NO descriptors, NO modifiers, NO features

Line 2: Main topic from Line 1 + add ONE specific modifier based on content

Line 3: Main topic from Line 1 + add DIFFERENT modifier

CRITICAL: Lines 2 and 3 should ADD to Line 1, not repeat specifics already in the content.

Correct Examples:
Clash Royale
Clash Royale Evolutions
Clash Royale Best Deck

Pokemon TCG
Pokemon TCG Meta Decks
Pokemon TCG Tutorial

iPhone 16
iPhone 16 Pro Review
iPhone 16 vs Samsung

❌ WRONG (Line 1 too specific):
Clash Royale Evolutions  ← Should be just "Clash Royale"
Pokemon TCG Meta  ← Should be just "Pokemon TCG"
iPhone 16 Pro  ← Should be just "iPhone 16"

Now extract 3 DIVERSE search terms:
