Generate 10 YouTube Shorts titles optimized for SEO and engagement.

VIDEO CONTENT:
{input}

TITLE FORMULA:
[Specific Detail/Number] + [Action/Result] + #shorts #[niche] #[topic]

SEO OPTIMIZATION IDEAS:
1. Extract specific keywords from the content (names, actions, items, techniques)
2. Include numbers/stats when present (1 minute, 3 tips, 10 pounds, etc.)
3. Lead with the most interesting/searchable moment
4. Use words people search: how to, tutorial, guide, tips, trick, hack, strategy
5. Be specific, not generic ("Lost 5 Pounds" not "Weight Loss Journey")

EMOTIONAL TRIGGERS:
- Curiosity: "Did This Work?" "What Happened Next?"
- Shock: "In 0.3 Seconds" "Only 1 Try"
- Achievement: "Finally Worked" "Won Against All Odds"
- Discovery: "Found This Trick" "Hidden Feature"
- Challenge: "Can You Do This?" "Try This"

PROVEN FORMULAS:
"[Number] + [Action/Result]" → "3 Tips to Win More"
"[Item/Name] + [Specific Result]" → "This Recipe Changed My Life"
"[Question] + [Specific]" → "Can You Beat This Time?"
"[Time] + [Achievement]" → "Lost 10 Pounds in 2 Weeks"

EXAMPLES (VARIOUS NICHES):

Gaming:
"Won With 1HP Left #shorts #gaming #fortnite"
"Found Secret Room #shorts #gaming #minecraft"
"Beat Boss in 30 Seconds #shorts #gaming #eldenring"

Cooking:
"3 Ingredient Pasta #shorts #cooking #recipe"
"Made This in 5 Minutes #shorts #cooking #quick"
"Best Pizza Dough Trick #shorts #cooking #italian"

Fitness:
"Lost 5 Pounds This Week #shorts #fitness #weightloss"
"10 Min Morning Workout #shorts #fitness #routine"
"This Exercise Changed Me #shorts #fitness #abs"

Tech:
"Hidden iPhone Feature #shorts #tech #apple"
"This Shortcut Saves Time #shorts #tech #productivity"
"Free Software Alternative #shorts #tech #tutorial"

Beauty:
"5 Min Makeup Look #shorts #beauty #makeup"
"This Hack Works #shorts #beauty #skincare"
"Drugstore Dupe That Works #shorts #beauty #affordable"

BAD EXAMPLES:
"Amazing Content" ❌ No specifics, no SEO
"This Is Cool" ❌ Generic, not searchable
"Check This Out" ❌ No keywords, no value

HASHTAG RULE (CRITICAL):
ALWAYS use this exact order: #shorts #[BROAD CATEGORY] #[SPECIFIC]

BROAD CATEGORY EXAMPLES:
#gaming - for all games (Fortnite, Minecraft, Clash Royale, etc.)
#cooking - for all food content
#fitness - for all workout/health content
#tech - for all technology content
#beauty - for all makeup/skincare content
#lifestyle - for vlogs, daily life
#education - for learning content
#diy - for crafts and projects
#comedy - for funny content
#music - for music content

EXAMPLES:
✅ "Title Here #shorts #gaming #clashroyale" (gaming is broad, clashroyale is specific)
✅ "Title Here #shorts #cooking #italian" (cooking is broad, italian is specific)
✅ "Title Here #shorts #fitness #abs" (fitness is broad, abs is specific)

❌ "Title Here #shorts #clashroyale #gaming" (WRONG - specific before broad)
❌ "Title Here #shorts #clashroyale #tips" (WRONG - no broad category)
❌ "Title Here #shorts #fortnite #gaming" (WRONG - order backwards)

GUIDELINES:
- Under 40 characters before hashtags
- Title Case
- Max 1 exclamation mark
- Extract specifics from the actual content
- ALWAYS use #shorts #[broad] #[specific] format

OUTPUT:
JSON array: ["Title #shorts #niche #topic", "Title #shorts #niche #topic", ...]
