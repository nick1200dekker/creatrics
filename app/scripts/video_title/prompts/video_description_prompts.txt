{input}

DESCRIPTION STRUCTURE:
Write a concise, helpful description with these elements:

1. OPENING (1-2 lines): Brief intro or context about what's in the video
   - Be conversational but clear
   - Can include a greeting or hook if natural
   - Use emojis sparingly (2-3 max in entire description)

2. MAIN CONTENT (2-3 lines): What the video shows or teaches
   - Be specific about the actual content
   - Use simple, clear language
   - Focus on value or entertainment

3. OPTIONAL ENGAGEMENT (1 line): Simple call to action if appropriate
   - Keep it brief and natural
   - Examples: "Drop questions below!" or "Let me know what you think!"
   - NO forced marketing language

4. SUBSCRIBE SECTION (if channel info provided):
   - Simple format: "Subscribe" with channel link on next line
   - Keep it clean and minimal

5. HASHTAGS (last line): Exactly 3 hashtags
   - #shorts (always first)
   - 2 more relevant hashtags

TOTAL LENGTH: Aim for 300-500 characters (not too short, not too long)

WRITING GUIDELINES:

WHAT TO DO:
‚úì Write in a natural, conversational tone
‚úì Be specific about what's in the video
‚úì Keep sentences simple and clear
‚úì Use normal punctuation and formatting
‚úì Include useful context when relevant
‚úì Match the creator's style if reference provided

WHAT TO AVOID:
‚úó AI phrases: "insanely close", "nail-biter", "peak performance", "this is what X looks like"
‚úó Overly dramatic language
‚úó Too many emojis (max 2-3 for entire description)
‚úó Excessive formatting with bullet points
‚úó Phrases like "You won't believe...", "Watch till the end..."

GOOD EXAMPLE:
"Quick Clash Royale tip! üéÆ

The easiest way to counter Pekka - drop a card in the middle to distract it, then push the other lane while it's walking.

Drop questions in the comments!

üëâ [channel link]

#shorts #clashroyale #tips"

BAD EXAMPLE (too AI-sounding):
"Clash Royale sudden death gameplay that came down to the final second! ‚öîÔ∏è Watch this insanely close match where one tower hit decides everything. The Pekka push, the Ice Wizard clutch attempt - every move mattered in this nail-biter.

This is what peak Clash Royale matches look like! üí°

#shorts #clashroyale #gaming"

BAD EXAMPLE (too casual/minimal):
"easiest way to counter pekka - drop card in middle

#shorts #clashroyale #tips"

FORMAT:
- Use line breaks naturally (not too many, not too few)
- NO markdown formatting like ** or ##
- Keep it readable and scannable
- Write AS the creator

OUTPUT ONLY THE DESCRIPTION - NO EXPLANATIONS, NO COMMENTARY:

############# LONG_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT #############
Generate a concise YouTube video description for the following content:

{input}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Keep it focused (200-500 words MAX)
- Write as the actual creator, not an AI
- NO placeholder links (like @YourHandle, [Link], discord links, etc.)
- NO section headers like "HOOK:" or "OVERVIEW:"
- NO bold text or markdown (no ** or ##)
- Only include links/resources that exist in the reference description

‚ö†Ô∏è FIRST 125 CHARACTERS ARE CRITICAL ‚ö†Ô∏è
The first 125 characters appear in YouTube search results and suggested videos. This is the MOST IMPORTANT part:
- START with relevant keywords naturally in the first sentence
- Pack in specific, searchable terms that people type into YouTube
- Include numbers/results if possible
- Make it benefit-driven and specific
- Do NOT waste these characters on greetings, intros, or generic phrases

STRUCTURE (write naturally, don't label sections):

1. OPENING (First 125 characters + 1-2 more sentences):
   - START with a specific claim or benefit (not "this guide will help")
   - Use numbers/data when possible ("save 1000 gold" not "save resources")
   - Get to the point in the first 5 words
   - Make it conversational, not promotional
   - What specific problem this solves or result it delivers

2. WHAT'S COVERED (short list):
   - 3-5 key points using asterisks (*)
   - Add relevant emojis if they fit the style
   - Keep each point brief (one line)

3. TIMESTAMPS (Include ONLY if transcript/content shows clear sections):
   - If you see a full transcript or detailed content breakdown with timing, add timestamps
   - If you only see a brief video concept/idea (not a full transcript), DO NOT add timestamps
   - Format as: 0:00 Intro, 1:23 Topic Name
   - First timestamp MUST be 0:00 to activate YouTube chapters
   - Use keyword-rich chapter titles (e.g., "3:45 Best Clash Royale decks for Arena 10" not just "3:45 Decks")
   - SKIP THIS SECTION if input is just a concept/idea without detailed timing information

4. WHO IT'S FOR (1-2 sentences):
   - Quick statement about target audience
   - Why they should watch

5. SIMPLE CTA (1-2 sentences):
   - Make the CTA relevant to the content (e.g., "Drop a like if this saved you gold")
   - Ask a specific question that relates to the video (not just "let me know in comments")
   - Keep it short and natural - one sentence max

6. KEYWORDS & HASHTAGS (end only):
   - Use primary keyword 3-4 times total (including first 125 chars)
   - Sprinkle 2-3 secondary keywords naturally
   - End with maximum 3 relevant hashtags (YouTube only highlights first 3)
   - No generic hashtags like #viral or #subscribe

DO NOT INCLUDE:
- Fake social media links (@YourHandle, etc.)
- Discord/community links unless in reference
- Resources sections with [Link] placeholders
- Multiple CTA sections
- "Connect with me" or "Follow me on" sections with fake handles
- Engagement baiting ("SMASH that subscribe button!")
- Generic "Related Videos" sections
- Any links not explicitly in the reference description

AVOID THESE AI-SOUNDING PHRASES:
- "In this comprehensive guide..."
- "Everything you need to know..."
- "Don't forget to like and subscribe..."
- "SMASH that like button..."
- "Hit the bell icon..."
- "Here's what you'll learn:"
- "I'm breaking down..."
- "Let me show you..."
- "In this video, I'll teach you..."
- "By the end of this video..."
- "Welcome to this guide..."
- "This guide is perfect for..."
- "Whether you're..."

WRITE NATURALLY - Sound like a real person talking to a friend:
- Use contractions (I'm, you'll, don't, can't)
- Be specific, not generic
- Reference actual specifics from the video
- Make claims sound earned, not promotional
- Use personal language ("my top picks" not "the recommended choices")
- Drop some personality (casual tone, slight humor if appropriate)

SEO KEYWORD USAGE:
- Use researched keywords naturally throughout
- Don't force keywords - write for humans first
- Front-load important terms in opening lines

If reference description is provided, extract ONLY real social links and match the writing style.

REMEMBER: The first 125 characters determine if people click. Make them COUNT!

OUTPUT ONLY THE DESCRIPTION - NO LABELS, NO HEADERS, NO COMMENTARY:
