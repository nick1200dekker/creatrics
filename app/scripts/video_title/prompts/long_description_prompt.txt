Generate a concise YouTube video description for the following content:

{input}

CRITICAL RULES:
- Keep it focused (200-500 words MAX)
- Write as the actual creator, not an AI
- NO placeholder links (like @YourHandle, [Link], discord links, etc.)
- NO section headers like "HOOK:" or "OVERVIEW:"
- NO bold text or markdown (no ** or ##)
- Only include links/resources that exist in the reference description

⚠️ FIRST 125 CHARACTERS ARE CRITICAL ⚠️
The first 125 characters appear in YouTube search results and suggested videos. This is the MOST IMPORTANT part:
- START with relevant keywords naturally in the first sentence
- Pack in specific, searchable terms that people type into YouTube
- Include numbers/results if possible
- Make it benefit-driven and specific
- Do NOT waste these characters on greetings, intros, or generic phrases

STRUCTURE (write naturally, don't label sections):

1. OPENING (First 125 characters + 1-2 more sentences):
   - START with a specific claim or benefit (not "this guide will help")
   - Use numbers/data when possible ("save 1000 gold" not "save resources")
   - Get to the point in the first 5 words
   - Make it conversational, not promotional
   - What specific problem this solves or result it delivers

2. WHAT'S COVERED (short list):
   - 3-5 key points using asterisks (*)
   - Add relevant emojis if they fit the style
   - Keep each point brief (one line)

3. TIMESTAMPS (Include ONLY if transcript/content shows clear sections):
   - If you see a full transcript or detailed content breakdown with timing, add timestamps
   - If you only see a brief video concept/idea (not a full transcript), DO NOT add timestamps
   - Format as: 0:00 Intro, 1:23 Topic Name
   - First timestamp MUST be 0:00 to activate YouTube chapters
   - Use keyword-rich chapter titles (e.g., "3:45 Best Clash Royale decks for Arena 10" not just "3:45 Decks")
   - SKIP THIS SECTION if input is just a concept/idea without detailed timing information

4. WHO IT'S FOR (1-2 sentences):
   - Quick statement about target audience
   - Why they should watch

5. SIMPLE CTA (1-2 sentences):
   - Make the CTA relevant to the content (e.g., "Drop a like if this saved you gold")
   - Ask a specific question that relates to the video (not just "let me know in comments")
   - Keep it short and natural - one sentence max

6. KEYWORDS & HASHTAGS (end only):
   - Use primary keyword 3-4 times total (including first 125 chars)
   - Sprinkle 2-3 secondary keywords naturally
   - End with maximum 3 relevant hashtags (YouTube only highlights first 3)
   - No generic hashtags like #viral or #subscribe

DO NOT INCLUDE:
- Fake social media links (@YourHandle, etc.)
- Discord/community links unless in reference
- Resources sections with [Link] placeholders
- Multiple CTA sections
- "Connect with me" or "Follow me on" sections with fake handles
- Engagement baiting ("SMASH that subscribe button!")
- Generic "Related Videos" sections
- Any links not explicitly in the reference description

AVOID THESE AI-SOUNDING PHRASES:
- "In this comprehensive guide..."
- "Everything you need to know..."
- "Don't forget to like and subscribe..."
- "SMASH that like button..."
- "Hit the bell icon..."
- "Here's what you'll learn:"
- "I'm breaking down..."
- "Let me show you..."
- "In this video, I'll teach you..."
- "By the end of this video..."
- "Welcome to this guide..."
- "This guide is perfect for..."
- "Whether you're..."

WRITE NATURALLY - Sound like a real person talking to a friend:
- Use contractions (I'm, you'll, don't, can't)
- Be specific, not generic
- Reference actual specifics from the video
- Make claims sound earned, not promotional
- Use personal language ("my top picks" not "the recommended choices")
- Drop some personality (casual tone, slight humor if appropriate)

SEO KEYWORD USAGE:
- Use researched keywords naturally throughout
- Don't force keywords - write for humans first
- Front-load important terms in opening lines

If reference description is provided, extract ONLY real social links and match the writing style.

REMEMBER: The first 125 characters determine if people click. Make them COUNT!

OUTPUT ONLY THE DESCRIPTION - NO LABELS, NO HEADERS, NO COMMENTARY:
