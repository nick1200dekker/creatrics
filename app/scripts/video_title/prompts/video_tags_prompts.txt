                    Generate relevant tags that will help the video rank well in YouTube search.
                    Return tags as a comma-separated list.
                    Focus on a mix of broad and specific tags.
                    Include trending and evergreen keywords when relevant.
                    The total character count should be between 400-500 characters.

############# USER_PROMPT #############
Generate comprehensive YouTube tags for the following video content:

IMPORTANT: Current date is {current_date}. Use current and relevant time references.

{input}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Generate 20-30 highly relevant tags
2. CRITICAL: Each tag MUST be 30 characters or less
   - YouTube REJECTS any tag over 30 characters
3. CRITICAL: Total character count MUST NOT EXCEED 480 characters
   - Count = sum of all tag characters + commas + spaces between tags
   - Example: "tag1, tag2, tag3" = 4+1+1+4+1+1+4 = 16 characters total
   - YouTube will REJECT tags if total exceeds 500 characters
   - Aim for 400-480 characters to stay safely under the 500 limit
4. Only use letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and apostrophes in tags
   - NO brackets, pipes, special characters, or emojis
5. Return as a comma-separated list

TAG STRATEGY:
- If a PRIMARY KEYWORD is provided, ALWAYS include it (or close variations) as the FIRST tags
- You need to think like this, where are people searching for when they search for a video like this so youtube knows where to show this content
- Include current year tags if relevant (current year: {current_year})

IMPORTANT: Balance between broad discoverability and specific targeting
- Broad tags help new audiences find your content
- Specific tags help engaged audiences find exactly what they want

OPTIMIZE FOR:
- YouTube search algorithm
- Suggested videos sidebar
- Browse features
- Google search results

FORMAT:
Return only the comma-separated tags, no numbering or explanations.
